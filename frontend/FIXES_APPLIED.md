# Fixes Applied to College Portal Frontend

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Router Future Flag Warnings ✅
**Problem:** React Router was showing deprecation warnings about future flags.

**Solution:** Updated `src/index.js` to include future flags:
```javascript
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true
  }}
>
```

### 2. Missing Manifest File ✅
**Problem:** Browser was trying to load `manifest.json` but it didn't exist.

**Solution:** Created `public/manifest.json` with proper PWA configuration:
```json
{
  "short_name": "College Portal",
  "name": "College Portal - Student Management System",
  "icons": [],
  "start_url": ".",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#2563eb",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

### 3. Missing Favicon ✅
**Problem:** Browser was trying to load `favicon.ico` but it didn't exist.

**Solution:** Created `public/favicon.svg` with a simple "C" logo and updated `index.html`:
```html
<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
```

### 4. Port Configuration ✅
**Problem:** App was trying to load resources from wrong port.

**Solution:** Created `.env` file with proper configuration:
```
PORT=3000
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
REACT_APP_NAME=College Portal
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

### 5. Cleaned Up HTML ✅
**Problem:** HTML was referencing non-existent logo files.

**Solution:** Removed references to missing `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` files.

## Current Status

✅ All warnings and errors have been resolved
✅ Application starts without console errors
✅ Favicon displays correctly
✅ Manifest file loads properly
✅ React Router warnings eliminated
✅ Port configuration fixed

## How to Start the Application

1. **Ensure Backend is Running:**
   ```bash
   # Backend should be running on http://localhost:8080
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\Shravan\Desktop\CollegePortal\frontend"
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access Application:**
   - Open browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal)
   - If port 3000 is busy, React will automatically suggest another port
